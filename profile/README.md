# Kagi Labs 🟡🛡️

Welcome to **Kagi Labs**, the security and orchestration hub for personal AI agents. We build tools that serve humans first, creating an ethical and truly personal internet.

## 🚀 Active Projects

### [Aegis](https://github.com/kagi-labs/aegis) 🛡️
The Universal Security Control Plane for AI Agents. It acts as a Man-in-the-Middle proxy for MCP tool calls, providing human-in-the-loop approvals, skill auditing, and static analysis.

### [Hashi](https://github.com/kagi-labs/hashi) 🪵
A local-first task orchestrator written in Go. Hashi acts as the "bridge" between user intent and LLM-driven tool execution, managing the full lifecycle of agent capabilities.

### [Minato](https://github.com/kagi-labs/minato) ⚓
The Unified Channel Harbor. Minato provides "Channel-as-a-Service" (Discord, Telegram, Web) for the rest of the ecosystem, ensuring a single source of truth for remote interaction and live session streaming.

### [Kura](https://github.com/kagi-labs/kura) 🏯
The Traditional Agentic Storehouse. A local-first storage abstraction layer with S3-compatible interfaces and MCP support, designed to eliminate "sync hacks" through reliable infrastructure.
