# Kagi Labs 🟡🛡️

Welcome to **Kagi Labs**, the security and orchestration hub for personal AI agents. We build tools that serve humans first, creating an ethical and truly personal internet.

## 🚀 Active Projects

### [Minato](https://github.com/kagi-labs/minato) ⚓
The **Orchestration Hub**. Minato is the central brain for communication and coordination. It provides "Channel-as-a-Service" (Discord, Telegram, Web), manages live session streaming, and orchestrates the flow of orders from the user to the underlying agents.

### [Hashi](https://github.com/kagi-labs/hashi) 🪵
The **Delegation Engine**. A local-first worker written in Go. Hashi acts as the execution layer where tasks are delegated. It manages the full lifecycle of tools, MCP servers, and CLIs to fulfill specific technical instructions.

### [Aegis](https://github.com/kagi-labs/aegis) 🛡️
The **Security Control Plane**. A Universal MITM proxy for AI Agents. It provides human-in-the-loop approvals, skill auditing, and static analysis to ensure every tool call is safe.

### [Kura](https://github.com/kagi-labs/kura) 🏯
The **Persistent Storehouse**. A local-first storage abstraction layer with S3-compatible interfaces. Designed to eliminate "sync hacks" by providing reliable infrastructure for agent memory and artifacts.
