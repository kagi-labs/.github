**Infrastructure for the Agentic Future.**

We build the missing tools, bridges, and firewalls for AI agents (like OpenClaw) to operate safely and effectively in the real world.

## 🚀 Active Projects

### 🌉 [Project Hashi](https://github.com/kagi-labs/hashi)
*(Formerly Scout)*
A secure local task orchestrator and control plane. The "hands" that let agents work with local files and tools safely.

### 🛡️ [MCP Firewall](https://github.com/kagi-labs/mcp-firewall)
A universal proxy for Model Context Protocol. Intercepts tool calls for human approval, ensuring agents don't burn down the house.

### 🤖 Agent BMO
*(Internal Prototype)*
Our living proof-of-concept. Developing infrastructure around OpenClaw to fix what's missing in the current ecosystem.

### 🛡️ Our Core Values
1.  **Safety First:** Agents need guardrails, not just prompts.
2.  **Local Control:** Your data stays home. Your agent works for you.
3.  **Utility:** Building tools that actually work.
